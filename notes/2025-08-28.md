- a 'gene' is a sequence of genomic data.
- human genome contains 30k-35k genes
- prokaryotic genome: one gene ~ 1 protein
- eukaryotic genes: one gene ~ > 1 protein because of 'alternative splicing'
- codons are in tripplets
- ACT is M is start
- TAA | TAG | TGA is stop

- study the gene structure of eukaryotes
