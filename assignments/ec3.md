i recalled hearing about this problem from robert sapolsky's lecture, so much
of my answer is drawn from memory from this series:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

since half brothers only share 1/2 parents, and each parent only accounts for
half of their genes, this means that half brothers should be expected to share
1/4 of their genes with one another.

other examples of relatives who share the same amount of generic material are:

- grandparents <-> grandchildren (grandparents share 50% of theirs with parent,
parent shared 50% with grandchildren, so 25% overlap on both)

- given a random person somewhere in the family tree, parents N generations up
should also share the same proportion of genes with their children N generations
down. grandparents and grandchildren are one such case where N = 1, and the person
is a parent. the proportion of genes shared should be (1/2)^N * (1/2)^N 
= (1/2)^(2N)
